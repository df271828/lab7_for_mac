# lab7_for_mac

It's some code for working with matrixes and vectors. Consists PCA realization and 
some basic functions for matrixes:
  transposition, 
  inversion, 
  trace of matrix,
  Gauss's method(including rank of method),
  norm of matrix(maximal and frobenius),
some basic functions for vectors:
  scalar multiplication,
  norm of vector,
  angle between vectors,
Also there're fuctions to write to binary and txt files, to read from binary and txt files.
